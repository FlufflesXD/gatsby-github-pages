Our martial arts style, Kuk-Sool Hapkido, has its roots in South Korea. At our club, we are dedicated to teaching more than just martial arts; we focus on imparting self-discipline and self-defense skills. Our journey in nurturing these values among our students spans several years.

Why Choose Our Club? We cater to individuals of all ages, equipping them with the necessary skills to defend against aggressive attackers. Our training emphasizes the importance of self-defense in situations where you are confronted by bullies or aggressors. It is crucial to understand that our martial art is intended strictly for self-defense and should never be used against friends or unprovoked individuals.

The cornerstone of our techniques and forms is the concept of circular motion and the redirection of energy. This approach is encapsulated in our club's saying: "A Circle is always your best friend." This philosophy underlines all that we teach and practice.

Our club operates throughout most of the year. Please note that we are closed during the following periods: Christmas Break, March Break, and the summer months of July and August. Please check out the Classes / Schedule section for specified time periods.

All instructions and communications at our club are conducted in English. Some of us can communicate in French if needed.
